#拷贝公钥到远程的机器，这个过程需要远程机器的密码

kent’s MacBook Pro:bin kentxxq$ ssh-copy-id root@192.168.22.222
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: attempting to log in with the new key(s), to filter out any that are already installed
/usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: 1 key(s) remain to be installed -- if you are prompted now it is to install the new keys
root@192.168.0.222-s password: 

Number of key(s) added:        1

Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh 'root@192.168.0.222'"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.

# 测试是否正常使用
kent’s MacBook Pro:bin kentxxq$ ssh root@192.168.22.222

```


如果目标ip进行过重装，因为本机存在拷贝记录，会告警提示，且需要重新设置
```bash
ssh-keygen -R 192.168.22.222
# 之后按照之前的步骤，可以重新生成操作
```
